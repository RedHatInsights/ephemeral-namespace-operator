= Ephemeral Namespace Operator

The ephemeral namespace operator (ENO) manages namespace reservations.
Given a `NamespaceReservation`, the ENO will provide the user a namespace with various resources created in it.

== Why

Why not e.g. give each user a static namespace and let them manage the resources themselves?  

- Users tend to leave resources hanging around after they're done with them.
  We want to ensure resources are cleaned up with minimal effort from users.
- Long-running environments require work to maintain.
  Instead users are encouraged to create new environments from scratch often;
  ephemeral environments should be treated as disposable.
  The problem is that creating a new environment from scratch can take several minutes, which is a significant drag on development time (including PR check durations).
  Thus the operator just needs to keep a few pre-populated namespaces "on deck" ready for the next reservation request.

== How

Each reservation has two optional fields:

. Duration: how long (in hours) before the namespace is deleted
. Requester: Only used to indicate who reserved the namespace.
  This field is not used by any automation.

Once a `NamespaceReservation` resource is created, the controller will pull a ready namespace from its pool of "on-deck" namespaces.
Users can find the checked out namespace in the status section of their `NamespaceReservation` or just run `oc get` on it.
Once the specified duration has expired, the namespace and corresponding `NamespaceReservation` will be deleted by the controller.
A user can simply delete a `NamespaceReservation` to end their reservation early.  This will also delete the corresponding namespace.

When the controller needs to create a new namespace to be added to the "on-deck" pool, it adds the following resources:

- `ClowdEnvironment`:  This will create deployments for Kafka, Kafka Connect, Minio, Prometheus, and feature flags.
- `FrontendEnvironment`: This sets up environment configurations for the github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-operator[frontend operator]
- `RoleBindings`: Access is granted to devs to edit resources in the namespace
- Secrets are copied from the base namespace.
