What is the Ephemeral Namespace Operator?
The ephemeral namespace operator (ENO) manages namespace reservations.
Given a `NamespaceReservation`, the ENO will provide the user a namespace with various resources created in it.

== Why

Why not e.g. give each user a static namespace and let them manage the resources themselves?  

- Users tend to leave resources hanging around after they're done with them.
  We want to ensure resources are cleaned up with minimal effort from users.
- Long-running environments require work to maintain.
  Instead users are encouraged to create new environments from scratch often;
  ephemeral environments should be treated as disposable.
  The problem is that creating a new environment from scratch can take several minutes, which is a significant drag on development time (including PR check durations).
  Thus the operator just needs to keep a few pre-populated namespaces "on deck" ready for the next reservation request.
- We have also incorporated the use of multiple pools. This feature allows users to choose from different pools with ready namespaces that  
  contain certain apps. Depending on the use case, this allows namespaces to better fit the needs of the user without having unnecessary apps. 

== How

Each reservation has multiple optional fields:

. Duration: how long (in hours) before the namespace is deleted
. Pool: Define which pool you are requesting a namespace from
. Requester: Only used to indicate who reserved the namespace.
  This field is not used by any automation.

Once a `NamespaceReservation` resource is created, the controller will pull a ready namespace from its pool of "on-deck" namespaces.
Users can find the checked out namespace in the status section of their `NamespaceReservation` or just run `oc get` on it.
Once the specified duration has expired, the namespace and corresponding `NamespaceReservation` will be deleted by the controller.
A user can simply delete a `NamespaceReservation` to end their reservation early.  This will also delete the corresponding namespace.

When the controller needs to create a new namespace to be added to the "on-deck" pool, it adds the following resources:

- `ClowdEnvironment`:  This will create deployments for Kafka, Kafka Connect, Minio, Prometheus, and feature flags.
- `FrontendEnvironment`: This sets up environment configurations for the github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-operator[frontend operator]
- `RoleBindings`: Access is granted to devs to edit resources in the namespace
- Secrets are copied from the base namespace.
